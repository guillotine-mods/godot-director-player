# Known bugs and open engine gaps

One entry per issue, worst first. Each carries the evidence it was found with, so
the next session can confirm it still reproduces before working on it rather than
trusting this file.

Numbers here were measured on the commit that added the entry. Re-run the tool
named in the entry before acting on a figure. Agreement with the lifted export
falls as the port gets more faithful, so a moved number is not automatically a
regression: see `.claude/skills/porting-fidelity-verification/SKILL.md`.

Resolved entries live in [`docs/bugs-closed.md`](docs/bugs-closed.md), under the
numbers they were filed with, because source comments cite them. Entry 25 appears
in both files: the fixed half is there, the remainder is here.

## The 2026-08-14 sweep, and what it says about reading this file

**All 66 entries were re-checked against the tree at `85b06dd3`, and 38 of them no
longer described it.** (Re-confirmed at `ecc6d070`, which landed mid-sweep and
touches only `scenes/preview/channel.gd` and one harness.) They are now in `docs/bugs-closed.md` in two sections: 20
whose defect was fixed and whose entry was never moved, and 18 whose *subject was
deleted* with the retired renderer and which therefore cannot be re-measured at
all. Seven more were narrowed in place, and one — 100 — was answered from the
reference and reclassified as not a bug. What is left below is 16 open entries,
7 narrowed ones and 4 not-a-bug signposts, one fewer than the sweep left because
106 has since been fixed and moved.

Two rules came out of it, and both are cheaper to follow than to rediscover:

- **A `**Status:**` line is not evidence.** Entries are written when a defect is
  found and are not reliably closed when it is fixed. 34 was fixed the day after it
  was filed and sat open for six days, during which 100 was filed *citing 34's open
  half* as the question it needed answered.
- **A commit subject is not evidence either.** In this repository a commit titled
  `bugs.md <n>: <restatement>` **files** an entry; it does not fix it. The two
  newest such commits name 105 and 106 and both are open below. Read the diff body,
  or the code at the path in the entry's own **Area** line.

**Three numbers are reused by unrelated entries, so a citation to one of these is
ambiguous and needs its title to disambiguate.** Found by an audit over both
files; recorded rather than renumbered, because source comments cite these numbers
and renumbering breaks that contract worse than the collision does. The sweep put
both halves of 33 and 34 in the closed file, so all three rows now read "closed"
on both sides and a bare citation resolves to two entries in one file.

| number | one entry | the other |
|---|---|---|
| 33 | closed: `gate.sh`'s `editable_text` asserts nothing | closed: `go to frame X of movie Y` read its own command word |
| 34 | closed: `the visible of sprite N` on an empty channel | closed: film-loop children drew from the wrong cast |
| 41 | closed: `member (<expr>) of castLib X` drops the library (`66baa6a5`) | closed: `play_suspends` flakes about half its runs (`b8466abb`) |

## Coverage debt — harnesses deleted with the retired renderer

These asserted rules that still matter, through an engine that no longer exists.
Nothing replaced them. Listed worst first, so that "we have no coverage of X" is
written down rather than remembered.

| Was | Asserted | Live equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| `tools/smoke.gd` | The first minute of play, end to end: menu, new game, opening sequence advances rather than loops, an item is picked up *and* leaves the room | **none.** `gate.sh` tests mechanisms one at a time and nothing walks a playthrough. The biggest hole |
| `tools/check_surface_coverage.gd` | Which Lingo names the host actually binds, against `docs/LINGO_SURFACE.md` | **none.** This is the tool that would have caught the `intersects` hole and could not, because it audited the retired host. Rebuilding it against `scenes/preview_lingo_host.gd` is the highest-value port on this list |
| `tools/probe.gd` | Not pass/fail: where the playhead went, what it repeated, where it stopped, in real time | **partly.** `tools/liveness_sweep.gd` records `(movie, frame, sprites drawn, what is holding)` per score tick off real awaited frames, and prints the state set and the holds for every movie of a corpus. It is a sweep and not an interactive probe: no `--marker`, no stepping, no arbitrary breakpoint, and it drives clicks only with `--click`. "Where did the playhead go in *this* situation" still has no tool |
| `tools/sprite_channels.gd` | A Lingo sprite write reaches the stage — not that a setter and getter agree | **none.** `preview_surface` proves the surface resolves, not that a write is consumed. This is the exact shape of the `moveableSprite` bug |
| `tools/lingo_handler_scope.gd` | Which script receives a message, in which order | **none.** `scenes/preview/scripts.gd` is unharnessed |
| `tools/sound_state.gd` | `soundBusy`, volume and `soundLevel` as a script sees them | **none.** `scenes/preview/sound.gd` is unharnessed |
| `tools/puppet_visibility.gd` | A puppeted sprite's visibility survives a transition | **none** |
| `tools/room_names.gd` | `nof` resolves to the room, and no two rooms share a key | **none.** It also printed "0 failure(s)" over 0 rooms, so it had stopped asserting anything long before it was deleted |
| `tools/collectables.gd`, `cliff_meeting.gd`, `wandering_characters.gd` | Scenario coverage: items reveal/stay/take, a dialogue runs to its end, guests are placed once | **none** |
| `tools/cursors.gd` | cursorfunk's cursor per channel | `tools/cursor_preview.gd`, in `gate.sh`, green |
| `tools/sprite_stretch.gd` | A sprite draws at its member's size | `tools/drawn_size_stability.gd`, in `gate.sh`, green |
| `tools/verify_film_loops.gd`, `film_loop_stretch.gd` | Film loops resolve to children, at the child's size | `tools/film_loop_cast.gd`, in `gate.sh`, green — the size half is not covered |
| `tools/score_diff.gd`, `place_diff.gd`, `member_diff.gd` | The container reader against the exported JSON | `tools/container_equality_check.gd`, in `gate.sh`, green, against the ProjectorRays dumps instead. The export oracle is gone for good |
| `tools/lingo_converge.gd`, `lingo_frames.gd`, `lingo_walk_diff.gd` | Interpreted clicks / frames / walks against the export | **unportable** — the oracle was the export |

Separately: **`tools/lingo_compile_check.gd` still exists and reports `PASS` over
nothing.** Its oracle was `data/lingo/`, deleted; it prints
`containers with no bundle under res://data/lingo (1)` and then
`PASS (11 checks, 0 failed)`. `README.md` called it "the regression gate for any
parser change". It was left in the tree because it gates the parser rather than
the renderer and comes back if `data/lingo/` does, but its green means nothing
today.
